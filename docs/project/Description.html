            <h2>Remarks</h2>
            <p>I really enjoyed to produce this application, so I worked more than 20h on it
                There were not a lot of help from the internet, so I tried out a lot of thing till I achieved my goals.
                When I could start again, I would not use hasMany and belongsTo anymore, but it was really difficult to
                change it in the end.</p>
